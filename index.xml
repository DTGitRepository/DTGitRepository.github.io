I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as a Junior DevOps Engineer and, probably like a lot of people, once I read the &amp;lsquo;Phoenix Project&amp;rsquo; I was sold.
After further research, I realised the principle and ethos surrounding DevOps was something I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about.
Focusing on pain points and ultimately solving problems in an efficient &amp;amp; costly manner whilst aligning with best practices is something I always hope to strive for.
Always happy to learn and get a new perspective - please feel free to reach out and connect.</description></item></channel></rss>
