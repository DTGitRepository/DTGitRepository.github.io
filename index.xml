The site is very simple in design though, using Hugo &amp;amp; hosted on GitHub Pages. See the repo for more information on the setup: https://github.com/DTGitRepository/personal-site/tree/main
I was thinking of implementing this as a so-called &amp;lsquo;production system&amp;rsquo; and then gradually add additional features. Services I could use:
GitHub Actions Terraform AWS S3 Static Site Route 53 Cognito If I do end up migrating to AWS, I can expand the site functionality.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://dturner.cloud/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2021 17:08:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dturner.cloud/about/</guid><description>Welcome!
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as a Junior DevOps Engineer and, probably like a lot of people, once I read the &amp;lsquo;Phoenix Project&amp;rsquo; I was sold.
After further research, I realised the principle and ethos surrounding DevOps was something I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about.
Focusing on pain points and ultimately solving problems in an efficient &amp;amp; costly manner whilst aligning with best practices is something I always hope to strive for.
Always happy to learn and get a new perspective - please feel free to reach out and connect.</description></item></channel></rss>
