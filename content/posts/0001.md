Believe it or not, the S3 pun was unintentional. The site _is_ very simple in design though, using Hugo & hosted on GitHub Pages. See the repo for more information on the setup: https://github.com/DTGitRepository/personal-site/tree/main 

I was thinking of implementing this as a so-called 'production system' and then gradually add additional features. 
Services I could use:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform?product_intent=terraform)
- [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)
    - [S3 Static Site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html)
    - [Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/)
    - [Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/)

If I do end up migrating to AWS, I can expand the site functionality. For the time being, however, I'll simply look to self-host this site as I recently picked up a RaspberryPi and was looking at various self-hosted apps - this seems like a good candidate.
