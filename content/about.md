**Welcome!**  
I'm currently working as a Junior DevOps Engineer and, probably like a lot of people, once I read the 'Phoenix Project' I was sold.  
After further research, I realised the principle and ethos surrounding DevOps was something I'm passionate about.

Focusing on pain points and ultimately solving problems in an efficient & costly manner whilst aligning with best practices is something I always hope to strive for.

Always happy to learn and get a new perspective - please feel free to reach out and connect.
